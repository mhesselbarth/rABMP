\description{
Simulate growth
}
\details{
Simulate growth by calculating the DBH increase and add it to the current DBH.
Also, i (iteration counter) will be increase and the type re-classified based
on the DBH: trees with a DBH smaller than 10 cm get the type 'sapling' and trees
with a DBH over 10 cm the type 'adult'.
